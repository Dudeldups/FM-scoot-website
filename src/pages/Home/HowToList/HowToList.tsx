        <p>
          Use the app to find the nearest scooter to you. We are continuously
          placing scooters in the areas with most demand, so one should never be
          too far away.

        <img src={RideImg} alt="" />
        <h2>Pick your scooter</h2>
        <p>
          We show the most important info for the scooters closest to you. So
          you know how much charge they have left and can see roughly how much
          it will cost.

        <h2>Enjoy the ride</h2>
        <p>
          Scan the QR code and the bike will unlock. Retract the cable lock, put
          on a helmet, and youâ€™re off! Always lock bikes away from walkways and
          accessibility ramps.
