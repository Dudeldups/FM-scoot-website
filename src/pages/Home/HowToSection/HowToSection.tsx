          <h3>Locate with app</h3>
          <p>
            Use the app to find the nearest scooter to you. We are continuously
            placing scooters in the areas with most demand, so one should never
            be too far away.

          <img src={RideImg} alt="" width="56" height="56" />
          <h3>Pick your scooter</h3>
          <p>
            We show the most important info for the scooters closest to you. So
            you know how much charge they have left and can see roughly how much
            it will cost.

          <h3>Enjoy the ride</h3>
          <p>
            Scan the QR code and the bike will unlock. Retract the cable lock,
            put on a helmet, and youâ€™re off! Always lock bikes away from
            walkways and accessibility ramps.
